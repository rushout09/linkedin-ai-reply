# LinkedIn AI Response Generator Chrome Extension

## What is this?

This Chrome extension helps you quickly generate AI-powered responses to LinkedIn posts. By accepting your OpenAI API key, it loads directly on LinkedIn and provides you with smart, context-aware replies to posts in your feed.

**Why I built this:**  
Scrolling through endless, often cringe-worthy LinkedIn posts can be time-consuming. This tool helps you save time, keep supporting your colleagues with meaningful engagement, and improve your account's reach and influenceâ€”all with minimal effort.
